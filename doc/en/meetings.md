# Meetings and Volunteers

In a workplace, or when there is consideration given in exchange for time and effort, a meetings policy with regular scheduled gatherings and some forms of record-keeping are par for the course and falls within plausible requirements for participation due to that consideration. In the case of contributions of volunteer time, effort, and expertise toward initiatives and projects without formal consideration, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to require or otherwise compel contributors to spend time on meetings and gatherings. Requiring time is nearly the opposite of accepting time, which is the basis of volunteer contributions.

A meeting of some where a meeting of all would be more effective, may make a partial meeting not only less effective, but perhaps a net waste of the time and energy spent by those in attendance.

## Persistent vs Atomic Teams

A Persistent Team is made up of volunteers who have committed to monitoring and maintaining initiatives and/or component projects on a somewhat regular basis. Persistent team members are still volunteers and are not required to participate at this level with any compulsion other than what they bring themselves.

This is re-stated here briefly as a reminder who might be participating in meetings vs who might benefit from meeting outcomes.

See [Teams](teams.md) for more information.

## Minutes and Notes vs Action and Outcomes

Meeting minutes can be useful, capture and publish them if they are.

*Agile for Volunteers* is intended to enable asynchronous collaboration; depending on attendance at meetings, or reviewing minutes of meetings, may reduce participation by offering additional tasks that do not fit the volunteer time budget. This is definitely true of Initiative-level meetings, which may be wide in scope and envelope many participants if they do attend.

There may be value in *Whole Team* meeting minutes (or some form of summary) since participation in any Initiative does imply membership in the Whole Team, so that attendance should not prevent participation. “You missed the meeting” should not justify exclusion, thus some form of useful communication about outcomes of such meetings is important, perhaps critical. Given this, there would be debate as to whether such summaries would be of value for *future* members of the *Whole Team*. From this perspective, Whole Team meetings are best considered Episodic, so that they exist on their own without presumption that those not participating as members of the Whole Team at the time are not expected to review minutes to catch up.

Outcomes of any particular meeting (Whole Team, Persistent Team, Atomic Team, Iteration Planning, etc) are more important than the in-meeting discussion. Outcomes will take the form of planning issues, task issues, bug and defect triage and assignment, documentation update proposals, and so on. The discussion of such things in a meeting is valuable, but the outcomes that lead to action and progress are essential. Capturing meeting outcomes in useful and usable ways is arguably more important than capturing formal meeting minutes.

Generally speaking, any meeting at any time will be made up of some or all members of a Whole Team, Persistent Team, or Atomic Team (or combinations thereof), as the exist at the time of the particular meeting, but the outcomes captured using Agile for Volunteers infrastructure (eg GitHub plan and task issues) may be reviewed by anyone entering or exiting any Team into the future. Given the nature of Atomic Teams in particular, asking or requiring review of previous meeting minutes is a substantial ask, while reviewing current open tasks, existing plan issues, and so on provides context and status much closer to the “location” within an Initiative where one might be joining (if only for one Iteration).

## Do What (Still) Works

Ultimately, the different and various Teams taking part in an Initiative and its various Component Projects should endeavor to establish a working methodology. If a daily in-person stand-up works for all involved, this may be worthwhile to pursue (though certainly a challenge in and of itself).

In the context of a single Iteration, a planning discussion as it begins, some planned mid-course discussion, and a retrospective are reasonable to consider. Should these be synchronous (ie a video call of some kind, an IRC-style chat, asynchronous Discussion comments or Issue feedback, or something else). Given the way any individual may be able to apportion their time during which they can contribute their effort and expertise, adding additional commitments during an Iteration may be a challenge. Indeed, *Do What Works*.

More likely, a Persistent Team will have more engagement on an ongoing basis around the various elements of an Initiative and/or Component Project. Regular meetings, asynchronous discussion, some specific communication scheme based on the particular issue or task or project… the possibilities are endless and are ideally tuned by the Persistent Team itself.

Generally speaking, if a meeting scheme and communication method can be established and put to use, such that the Volunteers participating to any degree in an Initiative are not pushed away, made less-likely to wish to contribute their time, effort, and expertise to the Initiative or Component Project, or are generally enabled rather than put upon, and if it is a single, unified scheme and method pair, congratulations, please author a paper or book about this. Otherwise, schemes and methods that work for the Team are almost certainly the way to go, once they are determined.

Remember, as Teams change, as progress is made, as Initiatives and Component Projects move along, there should always be room for updating schemes and methods.

Do what works, and do what Still works, accordingly.
