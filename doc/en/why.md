# Why Agile for Volunteers

Agile methodologies were developed by software developers for software developers and the infrastructure in which the business of software development takes place.

The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is the fundamental description of what Agile was conceived to be; we can start with one slight modification here:

> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working *projects* over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan
>  
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We can focus on a whole-team approach across Initiative and Initiative Focus Areas, rather than considering only the software parts. An Initiative may include zero software, but we may attempt to follow Agile methods in developing that Initiative nevertheless. Note that we are using the term **Initiative** for the over-arching plan for a solution to some challenge, and **Project** for a particular concrete implementation of some Initiative elements, typically found in a git repository for example.

 Agile in this base form, as it was initially conceived in 2001, and as it has been modified and adapted over the years is typically applied in a business setting with teams of employees or contractors

- collaborating with their customers and business interests
- working with management layers
- advancing a project along a timeline
- making progress through iterations
- achieving a goal or goals along the way

Our approach will begin here, but because we are an all-volunteer organization, we adapt the Principles described in The Agile Manifesto to Civic Volunteers working not only on Software challenges, but on all aspects of any Initiative as a Whole Team.

## The Volunteer Challenge

Civic Volunteer Time is Gold and must be valued as such.

With an all-volunteer organization pursuing open source community elevation initiatives, the Time, Effort, end Expertise that Civic Volunteers are willing and able to contribute to any given Initiative should not be wasted. To that end, we can attempt the following:

- use established, structured methods to organize effort and factor initiatives into achievable blocks
- apply established principles to process, communication, and assessment to maximize volunteer time and return on their investment
- comprehend throughout the two-way-street that is volunteer collaboration, that any transaction between two or more volunteers is time spent by all, for all involved

Use of terms such as **Specification** or **Schedule** may lead one to believe that there are specific requirements, perhaps release date or milestone expectations, that the design of an Initiative is set in stone and is therefore immutable, and so on. We eschew these notions by avoiding a formal project specification, opting instead for a collaborative, iterative approach to factoring a given Initiative via our [Issue Hierarchy](hierarchy.md) into Themes, Epics, Features, and User Stories for Abstract Planning, and then creation of User Story Tasks and tracking of Defects for Concrete Implementation.

Using the Agile Iteration approach to time commitment and effort management, coupled with our Atomic Teams concept that attempts to account for the fleeting nature of Volunteer Time, Availability, and Commitment, will ideally enable an observable sense of accomplishment and progress, while also capturing participation for purposes of attribution (and celebration!) when our initiatives reach a state where their intended audience can try them out and provide us with their feedback.

## Non-local Participation

Civic Volunteer Time may be Gold, but it is as difficult to come by as materials much more rare, and perhaps that much more valuable. We do have a theory.

We believe that Civic Volunteers can be found, but we also believe they may be looking… for Initiatives perhaps, maybe for specific Tasks, in general for a way to participate, whether for a few extra hours now and then or to actually join a particular initiative, or somewhere in between. It may be a mistake to constrain Civic Volunteer outreach in either direction to geographical locality or to formal organizations when individuals are just as capable of participating and contributing, perhaps more so. If we can find each other.

By constructing a hierarchy of Agile planning blocks (Theme, Epic, Feature, User Story) and implementation blocks (Task, Defect), we intend to make Initiative Plans and Implementations visible, observable, and most importantly discoverable, so that Civic Volunteer Time, Effort, and Expertise might find an outlet in an Initiative to which our prototypical Civic Volunteer might wish to contribute, without the need to wade through pages and pages of specification, or perhaps worse, limited or perhaps missing projects details of any kind.
