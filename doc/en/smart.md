# The S.M.A.R.T. Acronym for Tasks

In the second half of an article written by Bill Wake [XP123 - INVEST in Good Stories, and SMART Tasks](https://xp123.com/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/), the author provides some additional insight in the form of another useful acronym, which we can apply to the Implementation Tasks in our [Issue Hierarchy](hierarchy.md).

| Letter | Word         | Expanded                                                                                                      |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S**  | *Specific*   | Enough detail so that a potential contributor gets some idea what a task will accomplish                      |
| **M**  | *Measurable* | The ability for other members working on the initiative to agree that the Task is accomplished                |
| **A**  | *Achievable* | Make sure time and effort budgets, expertise, and scope make a Task fit into an Iteration (or two?)           |
| **R**  | *Relevant*   | The Task and its descriptive details should inform an observer how it fits into an Iteration, etc             |
| **T**  | *Time-boxed* | Avoid specific time estimation, but aim to fit Task completion into a single Iteration if possible            |

## Implementation

Where the Planning components of the Issue Hierarchy are more Abstract, the Implementation components are aimed specifically at Concrete realization of the abstract ideas.

Agile for Volunteers does not include a daily stand-up meeting by default (any group of people working on a Component Project or anything else are always welcome and encouraged to meet any time they believe it would be productive), so including these details and considerations in Task Issues can be a useful part of asynchronously sharing progress through any given Iteration interval.

One might reflexively apply the SMART elements below to a Software Development Task, but keep in mind that an Implementation Task may take many forms, not all of them as code in text files.

Treat the SMART acronym as a guide for creating and maintaining Task Issues before, during, and after the Iteration(s) for which they are relevant.

### Specific

The Abstract User Story should provide enough conceptual background for a Task so that a Task Issue is likely to be fairly brief. The reason to provide detail in a Task is to make active effort visible not only to other members of a Team, but to make active effort visible to any potential external contributors who would like to know more about an Initiative and a particular Component Project and its Tasks.

In addition, if a particular User Story is implemented on way, and detailed briefly in a Task, that User Story might be implemented in another way at some later time, and so the initial Task can be a starting point for the next effort. In the case of a software development task, for example, the first Task may be an implementation using one programming language or platform, the next Task for the same User Story might use a different programming language or platform. A nearly identical example with Language Translation is also valid, with one Task for translating source material to one language, and another Task at some other time for translating source material to another language.

The Task Objective is a great place to include specific information about an implementation plan.

### Measurable

Include very brief detail about how to go about determining that a Task will be considered Completed or Working or similar.

User Story issues include a Confirmation block, describing items that describe a Story that approaches Complete, or meetings the needs of a particular user. A Measurable Task will describe a strategy to reach those Confirmation items.

The Task Key Results is a great place to include information about a Measurability Strategy.

### Achievable

This is a property of a Task that is implied in how the previous items are described and planned. Based on how you, as the Implementer composing a Task on which to work during an Iteration, describe your plans and intentions, you may find you are expanding the scope of your work beyond what is likely possible within the Iteration (perhaps including other Tasks for the same Iteration).

A good test, perhaps, is to have someone else examine your Task and provide some feedback about whether it is overly-complicated, or perhaps complex, which may make it difficult to achieve as described. Here there may be an opportunity to Split the User Story and/or the Task so that a more constrained initial effort might yield an achievable outcome.

### Relevant

Another property of a Task that is implied in how the items above are described and planned. As described, is a Task going to be worthwhile spending your time, effort, and expertise on? Would it be worthwhile for anyone else? The actual concern is whether the plan of Implementation aligns the work with the goal(s), in the User Story OKRs and as part of the Initiative overall.

Here again a good test might be to have someone else examine your Task and provide some feedback regarding whether it, as described, represents potential return on the investment of volunteer time (and effort and expertise) to make progress and to integrate with the work of others in the current Iteration and into the future.

### Time-boxed

Finally, the easiest, or most difficult, part of the SMART acronym, because estimation can be profoundly difficult.

Keep in mind a base goal, to complete a Task within a single Iteration if at all possible. With practice, constraining a Task with considerations above and a familiarity with how you work, either by yourself or collaborating with others, will make estimation a bit easier, and you will be able to adjust your Task plans to fit within an Iteration without feeling pressured during, or disappointed after the Iteration.

Volunteering is not a race, and most if not all of any Initiative and its Component Projects are subject to discussion, assessment, and iteration so that the Whole Team can make progress and reach milestones along a path toward larger goals.
