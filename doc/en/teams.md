# Teams

There are two distinct but ideally similar notions of what a **Team** is:

- First is the interpersonal responsibility for collaboration and communication to advance a cause toward a particular goal.
- Second is the administration and management of membership regarding teams in tools, GitHub for example

The first group and sub-groups can be mapped to the second, but it is important to note that the first is most important for the purposes of Agile for Volunteers initiatives and projects and the advancement of each and all. Communication and Collaboration among People is essential.

For the purposes of Attribution (that is, credit for participation, contribution, and so on to any Initiative and/or its Component Projects), Team is an administrative construct, used as part of a best effort to avoid leaving anyone out, so to speak.

## Whole Team

Initiatives may be software-only, but this is unlikely. Anything from user experience to user interface to documentation to internationalization and localization and perhaps physical and mechanical elements, hardware components, and so on. If we call this a Whole Initiative, then all of those contributing to its various components are the *Whole Team*.

Tha nature of an all-volunteer effort makes Whole Team a challenge, but one worth tackling. Those involved in an Initiative in any way are on the Team, they are a part of the Whole Team, they should be invited always, and should always believe this to be true. Studies abound showing that any project with more diversity of opinion, insight, experience, and so on will benefit in the long term, possibly in the short term, and of course there are always learning opportunities when this diversity of inputs can be elevated by consuming a diversity of outputs, via connection, cooperation, and collaboration.

At the same time, it is important always to value the time, effort, and expertise of the Whole Team and its individual members.

## Persistent Team

While all participants in an All Volunteer organization or cohort or any group are a part of the Whole Team, there will tend to be, and perhaps there will need to be, those who champion Initiatives and who take on some of the administrative needs inherent in any attempt to reach Initiative goals.

Members of *Persistent Teams* are more likely to have meetings in a more formal sense (to be defined by the Persistent Team for itself), to assign tasks with some expectation that they will be addressed in timely fashion, and in general drive the Initiative forward with a certain level of professionalism, even when an associated Atomic Team has zero members for any particular Iteration interval.

Participation as a Persistent Team member is entirely voluntary and may come to an end at any time, ideally with communication and lead time to allow for re-sharing of any open tasks, etc.

## Atomic Team

Members of an *Atomic Team* are presumed to be temporarily engaged in any particular Component of an Initiative. The lifetime of an Atomic Team is typically one Iteration (eg 2 weeks, 14 days), during which there is the presumption that members of the Atomic Team are intended to contribute their time, effort, and expertise to particular component project tasks (including discussing planning and implementation strategy discussions, iteration retrospectives, etc).

Members of Atomic Teams are considered to be committed to the particular Component Project for the duration of one Iteration, such that when the Iteration comes to an end and any associated tasks, updates, discussions, and so on are completed, any particular member is presumed to be uncommitted. In an All Volunteer effort, it is essentially impossible to impose participation requirements, though they may be accepted on a volunteer basis (see *Persistent Team*).

Commitment to the Component Project for one Iteration implies continuous participation to some degree throughout the Iteration, though any Atomic Team member may choose to, or may need to, depart the Atomic Team for any reason during the Iteration interval. Communication of this departure is not required, though it is strongly encouraged.

Participation in additional Iterations as a member of an Atomic Team is optional but encouraged. Once an Iteration is ending and all associated wrap-up are concluding, communication of a desire or intent to participate in a future Atomic Team (the next Iteration in a series, or some future Iteration) with the Persistent Team is encouraged.

Why use of the term *Atomic*? From a technical perspective, when some transaction is *Atomic* it is presumed to be in some consistent state of participation and action for the duration of the transaction. Thus, *Atomic Teams* are presumed to be intact for the duration of the Iteration, but no other presumption about participation is made once an Iteration comes to an end.
