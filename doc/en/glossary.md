# Glossary of Terms for a Ubiquitous Language

Using terms in a consistent way is helpful to make understanding across an initiative easier, more likely, and less potentially-troublesome that allowing jargon or casual terminology to divide efforts.

Indeed, from *Design Driven Development* by Eric Evans (2003), Ubiquitous Language is described as an essential component to productive collaboration, conveyed in two quotes taken both from **Page 41** of that work:

> To create a supple, knowledge-rich design calls for a versatile, shared team language, and a lively
> experimentation with language that seldom happens on software projects.

and

> A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured. Domain experts use their jargon
> while technical team members have their own language tuned for discussing the domain in terms of design.

Ubiquitous Language is frequently references and described, these are links some links from the old days (though these considerations apply today, and tomorrow):

- [Martin Fowler on Ubiquitous Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html)
- [CarbonFive blog on Ubiquitous Language](https://blog.carbonfive.com/ubiquitous-language-the-joy-of-naming/)

While the *DDD* book and references above are born of the Software Development process and efforts to improve it, in the context of Agile for Volunteers we can apply this notion to Domain Experts and Technical Experts across Coding, Media Creation, Language Translation, User Interface Design, Marketing, Quality Assurance, and so on, since anyone taking on any of these roles may well be a Domain Expert, or a Technical Expert, or both, with familiarity with their particular jargon, their Lingua Franca of their domain.

If we are all speaking the same language, if we are all on the same page, we can spend time on collaboration rather than stumbling over communicationâ€¦

## Terms

These are the terms we will use in the context of Agile for Volunteers (taken most often from The Agile Manifesto and related works, or adapted for our non-software-development application here).
