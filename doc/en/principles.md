# Agile Principles Applied and Adapted for Volunteers

## Attribution

During each iteration, our whole-team approach benefits the Initiative *and* the Team, and our stated policy is to always enable full and transparent attribution of all contributed creative works to the right person or people who made those contributions. This is something that happens frequently (though note quite universally) in the world of software development, but we want to make sure that non-code creative work is also correctly and consistently attributed. Credit where credit is due!

As of this writing, our Foundation is making frequent and fundamental use of the GitHub platform to keep track of our Initiatives and Projects, which includes contributions of creative works to those Initiatives and Projects, with attribution. We will develop best practices and if possible, integrations with tools and platforms that are integral to the creative work development process so that we can present a consistent, transparent interface to anyone interested to know who made their favorite bits of an Initiative possible.

[GitHub Co-Author Attribution](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)

Using this scheme described, it is a small matter to make certain that collaborators get credit for their work and effort, which may well be pivotal. The work still has a primary *owner* and in cases where there is only one contributor, or two, or ten, or more, the owner of the bits owns the commit. However, adding the Co-Author trailing data in commits provides that transparency in a generally accepted an mostly-cross-platform-compatible way.

It is important to be attentive to including this information when changes and additions are committed to each project repository, since adding this information later becomes difficult, and since giving credit to collaborators should become second-nature, something you are unlikely to forget to do when you develop that muscle memory!

## Whole-Team, Pairing, and More

The whole-team approach found in Agile principles encourages collaboration across Initiative and Project components toward which the whole team participates and is responsible. *We are all in this together*, if you like, which leads to some other useful side-effects:

- Shared responsibility implies backups of familiarity
  - learn or tune other skills by backing up another person
  - fill in if the primary person is unable to wrap up a particular contribution
- Pair and mob collaboration adds value to the Initiative, Projects, and Team
- Cross-functional skills can be developed by pairing across the tech/non-tech “boundary”

### Atomic Teams

In order to adapt the Agile Iteration model to our Volunteer cohort structure, we will attempt to make Teams atomic for any individual Iteration without assumptions for the next Iteration.

During a particular Iteration, it may be possible to rely on the application of the whole-team approach to a subset of the overall Initiative, but with the Team technically disbanding at the end of an Iteration (and possibly re-forming in whole or in part for the next Iteration). There is no guarantee this will work well, or work at all, but it is one way to accommodate a volunteer cohort where predictable, regular, and recurring participation as one might expect in a more traditional workplace or general work environment cannot be guaranteed.

To make the most of whole-team benefit, we say that the Team is Atomic during the Iteration to set expectations across the Team, that those beginning the iteration on the particular Atopic Team will end the Iteration on the same Team, having attempted to complete, or at least make progress on, the parts of the Initiative and/or Project(s) each claimed for work during the iteration. If, at the end of a given Iteration, there is no sign of effort or attempted effort, there may be a discussion which follows, with the Whole Team, concerning participation in future Iterations.

Our Initiatives and Projects will follow a typical External Contributor workflow with the possibility of Pull Requests on the GitHub platform. This approach may be more appropriate if an individual contributor is unable to commit to the Atomic Team approach to Iteration planning.
