        # Implementation of an Agile User Story

        Plan an implementation strategy for a selected User Story Issue linked below,
        so that an observer might examine plan, effort, and outcome as part of collaboration
        discovery process.

        An implementation task may be split, merged, or spiked, so that implementation effort
        and available time can be reasonably planned and apportioned.

        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - story: --> User Story Issue located in a separate repository
        - merge-to: --> a Task that is a merging of this and other Tasks
        - merge-from: <-- a Task that was merged into this Task
        - split-to: --> a Task that is one of multiple Tasks derived from this Task
        - split-from: <-- a Task that was split into this and other Tasks
        - spike-to: --> a virtual Task for planning and estimation of related Tasks
        - spike-from: <-- a real Task connected to a virtual spike Task

        Merge-to and Split-to Task issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded User Story issue(s), as appropriate. Do not delete, mark as merge
        or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
