        # External Defect

        Please use this Discussion Category to describe an issue, problem, or defect
        you have encountered developing or interacting with this Component Project.

        We presume here that you are somewhat familiar with the details of this Component
        Project, its implementation, and the Initiative elements (User Stories, etc) on
        which it is based so that you can connect what you are seeing with what you
        should be seeing, and so that you know that this is the correct component project
        around which to begin this discussion.

        At the same time, a presumption that you are not a part of the team(s) working on
        the Initiative or its Component parts, thus *External*.

        Please take a moment to fill this in, your GitHub credentials will be used to
        attribute your contribution to this component project, and to the overall initiative,
        unless you would rather opt out.

        So that we can assess severity and priority scores, select at least one
        of each item in the checkbox blocks below, for Observations and for
        Frequency.

        If you have more detail for these, please include it down below.

        **NOTE** The *Observations* and *Frequency* sections immediately below mirror
        the Component Project sections, here we are concerned that *Documentation*
        issues may lead to these.

        For example, if a user is directed to delete all of the files in a directory
        without being explicit about the directory location, user *Data Loss* may result.
        (This is based on a true story from a large chip company in Oregon)
