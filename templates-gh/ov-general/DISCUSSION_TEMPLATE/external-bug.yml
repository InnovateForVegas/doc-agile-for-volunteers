        # External Bug

        Please use this Discussion Category to describe an issue, problem, or defect
        you have encountered using one or more components of this Initiative.

        One Initiative is composed of several component projects and other moving parts,
        there is no reason you should need to dive in to the inner workings to report
        some finding… you are using GitHub, though, which means you are a bit closer to
        the structure and inner workings than most.

        Thus the term, *External*.

        Please take a moment to fill this in, your GitHub credentials will be used to
        attribute your contribution to this initiative unless you would rather opt out.
