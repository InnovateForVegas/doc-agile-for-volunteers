        # Agile Feature Request

        Our Agile Feature describes a reasonably specific operation, action, input, output, user
        interface interaction, or general user (or automation) experience associated with an
        Initiative Theme.

        If the Initiative is an Office Suite and the Theme is a Spreadsheet component, an example
        *Feature* might be autofill formulae or adjustable column and row sizes, etc.
