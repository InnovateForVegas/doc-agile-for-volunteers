        # Agile User Story and the 3 Cs
        
        1. Select a User Card (imagine index cards, one color per user type).
        2. Describe in Conversation what this User would like to accomplish, with context, addressing concerns such as What and Why.
        3. Describe in simple list form (not checkboxes) Confirmation that we met those expectations as Acceptance Criteria.

        A user story is a description of what to do in somewhat abstract form, a task (issue) in a *related repository* will describe
        implementation of a particular User Story including Confirmation checks, which are essentially concrete **Key Results**.
        
        Multiple tasks in multiple repositories may implement a User Story or Stories.

        **Please compose Conversation and Confirmation elements in the first person, as though you are the selected User.**

        A particular Feature may have some nuanced requirements or expectations based on the type of User, their role, etc.

        Select any or all which apply to these particular facets of a Feature description, but keep in mind that there
        is usually a difference that could be missed if we assume everyone will need or want the same things…

        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - feature: --> the parent Feature in this Agile hierarchy for this User Story
        - task: --> Implementation Task located in a separate repository
        - merge-to: --> a User Story that is a merging of this and other User Stories
        - merge-from: <-- a User Story that was merged into this User Story
        - split-to: --> a User Story that is one of multiple User Stories derived from this User Stories
        - split-from: <-- a User Story that was split into this and other User Stories
        - spike-to: --> a virtual User Story for planning and estimation of related User Stories
        - spike-from: <-- a real User Story connected to a virtual spike User Story

        Merge-to and Split-to User Story issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded User Story issue(s), as appropriate.
        
        Do not delete, mark as merge or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
