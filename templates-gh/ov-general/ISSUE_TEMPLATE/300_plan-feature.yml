        # Agile Feature

        A **Feature** is a generalized behavior, experience, or expectation from a component of the Initiative.
        
        One or more User Stories will describe variations, subtleties, and specific considerations of a Feature,
        including potentially-required use of specific standard protocols, file formats, interfaces, and so on.

        We can describe a Feature directly as an **Objective** with measurable **Key Results** (OKRs).

  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: "## Feature Objective"
        
  - type: textarea
    id: objective
    attributes:
      label: Objective
      description: To be described in specific detail with one or more User Stories…
      placeholder: A Feature might be an adjustable perpetual calendar, grouping more specific User Stories about month and year flipping, etc.

        - A list of one or more measurable
        - and demonstrably-achieved results
        - Check off items in implementation(s)

  - type: markdown

        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - epic: --> a parent Epic in this Agile hierarchy for this Feature
        - story: --> a child User Story in this Agile Hierarchy for this Feature
        - merge-to: --> a Feature that is a merging of this and other Feature(s)
        - merge-from: <-- a Feature that was merged into this Feature
        - split-to: --> a Feature that is one of multiple Features derived from this Feature
        - split-from: <-- a Feature that was split into this and other Features
        - spike-to: --> a virtual Feature for planning and estimation of related Features
        - spike-from: <-- a real Theme connected to a virtual spike Theme

        Merge-to and Split-to Feature issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded Feature issue(s), as appropriate.
        
        Do not delete, mark as merge or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
