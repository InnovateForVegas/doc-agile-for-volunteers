        # Agile Epic
        
        An Epic is a collection of related Features which combine to form a
        level of functionality within an Initiative **Theme**.
        
        One or more Epics will form the basis of one or more Agile Iterations. It is likely that any
        Epic(s) will span more than a single Iteration, but this may vary. 

        We can describe an Epic directly as an **Objective** and **Key Results** (OKRs), with more granular
        descriptions in each related **Feature**.

        - A list of one or more measurable
        - and demonstrably-achieved results
        - Check off items in implementation(s)

        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - theme: --> the parent Theme in this Agile hierarchy for this Epic
        - feature: --> a child Feature in this Agile hierarchy for this Epic
        - merge-to: --> an Epic that is a merging of this and other Epic(s)
        - merge-from: <-- an Epic that was merged into this Epic
        - split-to: --> an Epic that is one of multiple Epics derived from this Epic
        - split-from: <-- an Epic that was split into this and other Epics
        - spike-to: --> a virtual Epic for planning and estimation of related Epics
        - spike-from: <-- a real Epic connected to a virtual spike Epic

        Merge-to and Split-to Epic issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded Epic issue(s), as appropriate.
        
        Do not delete, mark as merge or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
