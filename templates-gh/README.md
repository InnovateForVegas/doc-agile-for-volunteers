# GitHub Issue and Pull Request Templates

In order to make issues and pull requests structured (with similar information as needed per issue and pull request type) and consistent for newcomers to projects and for those more experienced.

Each subdirectory is intended to be moved to the .github directory within a given initiative component project repository. Subdirectories are named according to the component type.

## Changes to these templates

Obviously templates can change as needed per component project repository. It may be that a generally-applicable change becomes apparent, in which case please consider making these changes available to this repository content, if they can be made suitable general for use across other component project into the future.

## Collaborative Development

These templates for GitHub were iterated upon in their initial form as part of the [Project-ACT Tessellation Initiative](https://github.com/Project-ACT/ov-tessellation).
